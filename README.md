# Customer-behavioural-Analysis
An investigation on the behavioral pattern of customers based on their purchasing power,  buying habits and their locality can help marketing experts and business stakeholders to make  reliable data-driven decisions surrounding customerâ€™s product preference, target  advertisements and service offers in order to meet target demands, beat market competition and inform target marketing. This analytical research focuses on market research based on  customer order history for an online retail store which established that total quantity  purchased, and net price are highly correlated than other transactional attributes.
